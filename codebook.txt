The run_analysis.R is program does the data preparation and then the 5 steps in local workspace. required as described in the course instructions.

Download the dataset:
Dataset is downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset in local workspace.

Assigning variables in the data:

features : features.txt contains 561 rows and 2 columns
The features in this database are from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

activities : activity_labels.txt contains 6 rows and 2 columns
The list of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its labels

subject_test : test/subject_test.txt contains 2947 rows and 1 column
subject test contains data of 9 out of 30 volunteer test subjects being observed

x_test : test/X_test.txt : contains 2947 rows and 561 columns
x test variable contains recorded features from test data

y_test : test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
y test variable contains test data of code labels

subject_train : test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
subject train contains training data of 21 out of 30 volunteer train subjects being observed

x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
x train variable contains recorded features from train data

y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
y train variable contains train data of code labels

Merging the training and the test data sets to form one final data set:

X : contains 10299 rows and 561 columns which is created by merging x_train and x_test with rbind() function
Y : contains 10299 rows and 1 column which is also created by merging y_train and y_test with rbind() function

subject : contains 10299 rows and 1 column which is created by merging subject_train and subject_test with rbind() function
mergedData (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging subject, Y and X using cbind() function

FinalData : contains 10299 rows and 88 columns which is created by subsetting mergedData by selecting columns: subject, code and measurements on mean , standard deviation for each of them.

The data set with descriptive variable names, code column in mergedData renamed into activities
All Acc in column names are replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column names are replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column names are replaced by Body
All Mag in column names are replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column names are replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column names are replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalData contains 180 rows and columns is created by sumarizing mergedData by taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouped by subject and activity.
Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file using write_txt() method.
