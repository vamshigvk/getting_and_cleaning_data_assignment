Files:
CodeBook.md is a code book written in markdown that describes the variables/objects, data, and any cleaning and changes done or applied on the data. 
FinalData is an text file which contains the final output data generated by the run_analysis.R program and saved using write_table method.

run_analysis.R is an R program which performs the data cleaning and preparation and the 5 steps mentioned in the course project instructions:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
